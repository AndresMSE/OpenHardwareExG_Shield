=Test Harness=
 * we'll read the ladder with a multi-meter
 * new capacitor sits under tab of test harness
 * left angle bracket intersects the screws on the test harness
 * board fits too tight in test harness
    (adding a second top "C" bracket seems to address this)
    (may need a bit more space around the edges)
 * look at the location of screws wrt arduino for the test harness

=Sheild=
 * exclude test points in solder mask (solder lumps push pins to side)
 * review VCAP capacitor values

#DONE (rev 0.1): FIX two errors on board:
#
# * crowbar circuit needs fixing
#   - Desoldering U2 temporarily addresses the crowbar.
#   - two changes are required:
#     * replace the 10uf with 100nf
#     * add 330uF ramp-up capacitor before the crowbar just after L4
#       (T495D337K010ATE150 Tantalum Capacitor - Solid SMD 10volts 330uF)
#
# * ADS pins 35 and 36 (ADS129x_~PWDN~_ISO and ADS129x_~RESET~_ISO)
#   were tied LOW in prototype but should have been tied HIGH.
#    - Fixed on pcb, commit 72ef22c5d505a4bb687d45671e774ddb12a3666a
#    - We were able to desolder these two pins on the ADS chip and bend them up,
#      then we soldered a jumper wire to the power at U4
