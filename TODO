 * fudicial marks have paste layer
 * investigate forking/pull-requesting
    https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library
    for our custom modules

=Test Harness=
 * Shortcomings we will ignore
   * serial output registers start uninitialized and thus in an undefined state
     - we see (momentarily) a flash where both the success and fault lights are
       lit -- perhaps the board under test may have a brief flicker of power
       before it is supposed to
   * new capacitor sits under tab of test harness
   * left angle bracket intersects the screws on the test harness
   * look at the location of screws wrt arduino for the test harness

#DONE (rev 0.1): FIX two errors on board:
# * exclude test points in solder mask (solder lumps push pins to side)
# * review VCAP capacitor values
#
# * crowbar circuit needs fixing
#   - Desoldering U2 temporarily addresses the crowbar.
#   - two changes are required:
#     * replace the 10uf with 100nf
#     * add 330uF ramp-up capacitor before the crowbar just after L4
#       (T495D337K010ATE150 Tantalum Capacitor - Solid SMD 10volts 330uF)
#
# * ADS pins 35 and 36 (ADS129x_~PWDN~_ISO and ADS129x_~RESET~_ISO)
#   were tied LOW in prototype but should have been tied HIGH.
#    - Fixed on pcb, commit 72ef22c5d505a4bb687d45671e774ddb12a3666a
#    - We were able to desolder these two pins on the ADS chip and bend them up,
#      then we soldered a jumper wire to the power at U4
#
# * we'll read the ladder with a multi-meter
# * board fits too tight in test harness
#    (adding a second top "C" bracket seems to address this)
#    (adding a set of washers below the C brackets also works)
