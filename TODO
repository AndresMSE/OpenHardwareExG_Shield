FIX two errors on board.

 * crowbar circuit needs fixing
   Desoldering U2 temporarily addresses the crowbar.


 * ADS pins 35 and 36 (ADS129x_~PWDN~_ISO and ADS129x_~RESET~_ISO)
   were tied LOW in prototype but should have been tied HIGH.
    - We were able to desolder these two pins on the ADS chip and bend them up,
      then we soldered a jumper wire to the power at U4
